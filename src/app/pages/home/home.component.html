          The Monty Hall is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle,
          loosely based on the American television game show
          <em>Let's Make a Deal</em> and named after its original host,
          <em>Monty Hall.</em><br /><br />
          Player is presented with three closed doors - behind one is a car, and
          behind the other 2 are goats. Player has to choose one of the three
          doors. while it remains closed presenter opens a door with a goat
          behind it. Now the Player is given an opportunity to switch to the
          remaining closed door or stick with the initial choice.<br /><br />This
          simulation helps to undertand when the player chooses to switch the
          doors, there is a greater chance of wining the game than sticking into
          the first choice.<br /><br />Notice that this decision only increase
          the chance or the probability of wining. Cannot gauratee the player is
          always going to win. ðŸ¤žâœŒ
